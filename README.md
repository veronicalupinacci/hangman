# Hangman Game (Python)

This is a personal project written in Python. 

The user will know how long is the word, has to guess the letters composing it (max 5 wrong entries) and then gets 3 chances to guess the word.
The game keeps playing until the user enters N to not continue playing.

I will work on the GUI next
